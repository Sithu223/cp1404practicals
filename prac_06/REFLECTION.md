# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I now sketch a quick plan which prefer classes,functions and time estimatesâ€”before coding, which helps me catch issues early.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to build in more debugging time and ask for help sooner when stuck.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I keep clear docstrings with time estimates, make small commits with descriptive messages, and follow naming and formatting.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I will quit pasting unfamiliar snippets without full understanding and avoid last minute by starting tasks earlier.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I want to suggest to add a brief hands-on session on writing simple Python unit tests to boost our testing skills and cut down on debugging.
